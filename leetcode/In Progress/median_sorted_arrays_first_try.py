    THIS SOLUTION IS A CORRECT APPROACHâ€”IF and ONLY IF the arrays contain unique elements.
    I have not finished fixing bugs because it will break in non unique elements.
    This attempts to partition the arrays by guessing at the median. This actually takes O(log(max(a_m,b_n))
    BETTER TO JUST FIND THE INDICES i and j in each array, SINCE ARRAYS ARE SORTED.
    
    Two Sorted Arrays of size m and n
    Find median of them both in O(log(m+n)) time.
    
    We're going to ignore duplicates for now.
    
    Array a and Array b
    
    CASE 1: sequential
        a_0 < a_m < b_0 < b_n
        OR
        b_0 < b_n < a_0 < a_m
        EASY: just pick (m + n)//2 element if m+n is odd, else average (m+n)//2 (m+n)//2 + 1 elements
    
    CASE 2: overlap
    a_0 = 0, a_1 = 3, b_0 = 2
    nums1 = [1, 3]
    nums2 = [2]
    Since a_0 < b_0 and b_0 < a_m, we know the arrays overlap.
    We could merge them together, merge sort style. This would take O(min(m,n)) time. Then select O(1)
    
    HERE'S WHAT WE CAN DO: we do not know the exact ordering of numbers. BUT GIVEN A SPECIFIC NUMBER,
        we can partition our two arrays in logarithmic time, and determine how large the halves are.
        
        We want to find a number such that the arrays are partitioned into two halves differing by at most one.
    
    STRATEGY:
        Modified binary search.
        low = min(a_0,b_0)
        high = max(a_m,b_n)
        guess = low + (high - low)//2
        a_below = b_below = 0
        a_above = len(a)
        b_above = len(b)
        while abs((a_below + b_below) - (a_above + b_above)) > 1:
            * partition around current guess
            * compare sizes of halves
            * repeat
        return closest value to current num that's present in the arrays.
